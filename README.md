# Moppys-Maze
A simple knock off version of pacman. I implemented a version of the A* pathfinding algorithm to control the enemy AI, but adjusted the script slightly 
so they would move in a way that was similar to the Pacman ghosts
A video of some gameplay can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-JgDFEAvYc
Will hopefully be adding more functionality such as more levels and adding more enemies for a higher level of difficulty
